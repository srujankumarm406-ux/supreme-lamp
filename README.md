# Prodigy InfoTech Generative AI Internship - Task 5

## Task Name
Neural Style Transfer

## Objective
Implement Neural Style Transfer to combine the content of one image with the artistic style of another image.

## Description
In this project, Neural Style Transfer is implemented using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. 
The model takes two images:
1. Content Image
2. Style Image

It generates a new image that keeps the content of the first image and applies the artistic style of the second image.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## How It Works
1. Load content and style images.
2. Preprocess images.
3. Apply pre-trained style transfer model.
4. Generate stylized output image.
